# Flow
* One must be involved in an activity with a clear set of goals and progress. This adds direction and structure to the task.
* The task at hand must have clear and immediate feedback. This helps the person negotiate any changing demands and allows them to adjust their performance to maintain the flow state.
* One must have a good balance between the perceived challenges of the task at hand and their own perceived skills. One must have confidence in one's ability to complete the task at hand.

**Fluency** + **immediacy** + **autonomy** + *a little bit of challenge* = **fun**
